After a self-imposed break from social media (during a recent heavyweight fight with a respiratory bug I caught from a grandkiddo), I've discovered another sector of the [Fediverse](https://joinfediverse.wiki/What_is_the_Fediverse%3F) which may deserve your attention. It's called [Calckey](https://joinfediverse.wiki/What_is_Calckey%3F).

Forked from the [Misskey](https://joinfediverse.wiki/What_is_Misskey%3F) microblogging platform widely used in Asia, Calckey provides what some see as a more polished version of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) --- perhaps what Mastodon should've been in the first place. Given the Fediverse's interconnected nature, you can interact with Mastodon from Calckey and *vice versa*. You even can import/export a variety of items --- *e.g.*, your Mastodon "follows" --- between the two.

Calckey apparently is new enough that it doesn't have a real mobile app yet, *but* its [PWA](https://calckey.social/apps) is impressive and easily installed on your device of choice. As for me, I prefer Calckey's desktop browser experience:

Although I remain on mastodon.social, I've also signed up with Calckey, at its [calckey.social](https://calckey.social) instance, as [@BryceWray](https://calckey.social/@BryceWray).

Whether you have yet to sample the Fediverse, or are already on Mastodon but curious about other Fediverse platforms, you might want to give Calckey a try.
