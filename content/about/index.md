Welcome.

Eons ago, when the web[^web] [was a new thing](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html), [ISPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) tended to provide free file space for people to have [little personal websites](https://consumerist.com/2015/03/20/where-did-everyone-from-the-90s-go-when-we-all-got-facebook-and-quit-web-1-0/). Back in those days, one did so with whatever [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) client one could find, what we now know as static [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) files (but not [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/), not yet anyway), and lots and lots of [dialup modem noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dial_up_modem_noises.ogg).

[^web]: Hey, we even capitalized it as *Web* back then and used the two-word term *Web sites*. For that matter, I held out for as long as possible before succumbing and calling it the *web*, no capital letters, and referring to *websites*. Then again, I also insist on using the [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma). I can be incorrigible.

And, yes, I had one, back on what then was called [GTE.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTE). In fact, I was a "Charter Subscriber" to that ISP.

Yet, as that free-file-space thing gradually went away, so, too, did many personal sites --- mine among them.

Over the years, database-driven content management systems ([CMSs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system)) like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) appeared. They provide click-and-drag ease in building a personal site, but they tend to be [security nightmares unless properly maintained](https://ithemes.com/2017/01/16/wordpress-security-issues/), which many aren't. They also introduce a great deal of technical overhead.

And then there are creatures like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, which [for all too many people](https://ia.net/topics/take-the-power-back) have become the only Web-based locations for ordinary folks’ thoughts. Of course, [all these platforms want](https://adammclane.com/2013/03/in-social-media-you-are-the-product/) is to grab your information, show you ads, and --- particularly in the case of Facebook --- contribute to the [dumbing-down of your culture](https://www.salon.com/2017/07/16/how-social-media-is-dumbing-down-our-communication/) and the [political polarization of your society](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585317305208). What's the harm??!?

(Don't worry. This site is, and will remain, apolitical by design unless we're nearing World War III or something along those lines. Maybe even then, since I doubt my little ol’ site is going to stop The Really Big One.)

Anyway, it seemed a lot of the fun had gone out of puttering around on the web and actually creating content. Then --- first among the techno-cognoscenti and, more recently, among us ordinary folks --- came websites powered by [static site generators (SSGs)](https://www.staticgen.com) and written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I found them a source of curiosity at first but gradually became more interested in the prospect, especially as I learned more about their [technical advantages](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reasons-ditch-cms-static-site-generator/); and, so, here we are.

## As for me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

So, who am I, and what business do I have putting yet another site on this already overstuffed web?

I love to write. More often than not, the muse is in one of her oh-let's-go-"techy"-instead-of-"fictiony" moods and so she tells me to write more stuff on this site. Sometimes it's even about the app or apps I use to write, which leads me to the next point&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Am I anybody special? Nope; just an ordinary working guy[^retired] who, for decades, has used a multitude of computing devices, operating systems, and apps --- and learned a few things (and formed more than a few opinions) along the way. I've been told I can make complicated things easier to understand, and I try to do the same here.

[^retired]: I have since [retired](/posts/2021/09/transition/).

Finally: since the Kewl Kids went off and left us non-SSG users in the dust, it behooved me and my geek's curiosity to give this stuff a try, and that was the main reason I started the site in the first place. As one who's long delighted in hand-coding websites whenever possible, I love seeing the comeback of static sites.

Thank you for stopping by. I hope you find this site a source of various little nuggets of helpful info, and occasionally a laugh or two --- even if I hadn't intended it, but especially if I had.

Again, welcome.
