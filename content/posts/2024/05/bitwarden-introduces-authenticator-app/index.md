Having written [three](/posts/2021/09/taming-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps/) [earlier](/posts/2023/07/from-raivo-otp-to-2fas/) [pieces](/posts/2024/03/ente-auth-for-totps/) about authenticator apps, from which you can obtain the time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) you'll need to log into various websites and services, I was interested in today's [announcement](https://bitwarden.com/blog/bitwarden-just-launched-a-new-authenticator-app-heres-what-it-means-to-users/) of the new Bitwarden Authenticator app. It's very early in its development cycle and thus currently won't be of much use to many, but it should get a lot better in the near future.

The app is free, doesn't require a separate [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) account (but can certainly be used with Bitwarden, especially if you've opted not to use the [paid version's built-in TOTP support](https://bitwarden.com/help/integrated-authenticator/)), and is available for both iOS and Android. Whether you will find it of use right now, in its early version, comes down to how you'd answer one question: "Do you have any existing TOTPs?" That's because, at this time, Bitwarden Authenticator can't import existing data from another authenticator app, meaning you'll have to start from scratch. The importation capability is on the way, according to a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitwarden/comments/1chob6h/comment/l23u9ev/) by a self-identified "Bitwarden Developer" who gave no date for the feature addition other than "soon."

Since Bitwarden Authenticator *(iOS version shown)* can't yet import TOTP data from other sources --- and I frankly didn't want to go through the rigamarole of generating a few on-screen QR codes from my existing data so this app could scan them --- this is all I can show you for the app as of this post's original appearance.

That aside, Mrs. Lincoln, I do expect good things from this app. After all, it's from Bitwarden, a company with years of experience demonstrating its superb expertise in the field of password management for the masses. So, when a wobbly-legged puppy shows up in your presence, but you know it comes from a long line of outstanding show dogs, you tend to have high hopes for what the little drooler will be able to do under the bright lights before too long.
