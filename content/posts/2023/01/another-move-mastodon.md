Earlier today, the little band of followers of my presence on the [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org) instance of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) suddenly found themselves seeing my comments, boosts, and the like coming from a different location: [mstdn.social](https://mstdn.social). Here's a brief post to explain why, but --- spoiler alert --- it's **not** because I had any qualms about Fosstodon. The truth is quite the opposite.

<!--more-->

Let me make clear above all else that Fosstodon is an **outstanding** instance and a **great** Mastodon home for English-speaking techies, especially those who are interested in the free open-source software (FOSS) from which it derives its name. I [still](/posts/2022/10/move-mastodon/) **highly** recommend it.

So why did I leave it?

Well, at least as of this writing, I haven't *completely* left it; my account there is in "redirect" mode, and all the posts/toots I made there over the last few months remain intact. However, putting it in that mode moved the account's followers to the [mstdn.social account](https://mstdn.social/@BryceWrayTX) which, through the kind help of mstdn.social admin [@stux](https://mstdn.social/@stux), I'd gotten reactivated months after I deleted it.

It wasn't that there was anything wrong with Fosstodon. Rather, I decided, **I** wasn't entirely right for **it**. I reached this conclusion after seeing, and briefly participating in, a thread which began last night with this from another Fosstodon user:

{{< stoot "fosstodon.org" "109644650964219975" >}}

. . . but please read [the entire thread](https://fosstodon.org/@mairhart/109644650964219975) so you'll get the full picture.

Does any of this reflect an official Fosstodon position about what appears on its local timeline? No, at least not as far as I know --- but the thread made me think **very** hard about the content to which I was subjecting other Fosstodon users. I mean, many if not most of them likely have little or no interest in seeing the *non*-tech content in certain posts/toots I either write or boost.

For example, I've seen a number of Fosstodon users pointedly expressing zero interest in sports, so it's likely they're annoyed by those sports-related items that other users, such as I was until today, write or boost; and that's absolutely fair. The same probably goes for posts/toots relating to U.S. current events, particularly since many Fosstodon users live far from the United States.

In the end, I decided it would be better if I were on a less specifically targeted instance --- so off to mstdn.social I went.

After all, I didn't want to risk being (or continuing to be) one of Those Guys:
