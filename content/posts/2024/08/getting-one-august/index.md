The title pretty well says it all: I am issuing this post only to get one in for August. That's because, otherwise, I'd have failed to do a new post during an entire calendar month for the first time since the site went live nearly six years ago. Didn't wanna do that.

Why has my writing output declined so much in recent weeks? It's fairly simple, actually. Recovery from my second major surgery in a four-month period is ongoing (and going well, I should add). At least partly because of that, I haven't been as "plugged into" my usual sources of inspiration for writing new pieces.

This, too, shall pass, as it's been said.

In the meantime, I didn't want to let August pass without putting up at least one post, however trivial such a motive is. So here is that post. Thanks for reading.
