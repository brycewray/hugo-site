Each entry in the "Mixed nuts" series is a collection of random and, occasionally, relevant observations. The series originally was inspired, as noted in the [first "Mixed nuts" post](/posts/2019/11/mixed-nuts-2019-11/), by the famed "Scattershooting" newspaper columns penned by the late Blackie Sherrod.

Sliding into the "Wow, finally, I **did** live to see it" category is [this week's 1.0 release](https://support.typora.io/What's-New-1.0/), after years of beta testing, of the cross-platform[^Elec] [Typora](https://typora.io) text editor app. After a fifteen-day free trial of the full app, the price is fifteen bucks. That's a **one-time** license fee, so you inveterate subscription haters can stand down. Give it a try. (I'm writing this on it right now, as a matter of fact.)[^tipReIE]

[^Elec]: Yes, it's [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based. I'm okay with that, especially when it enables wide compatibility for an app of Typora's well-known quality.

[^tipReIE]: Most users of other Markdown editors --- say, [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) --- probably will prefer to use Typora in its Source Mode at the start. Just sayin’.

*A pro tip for anyone who, as do I, lives in a place where fall is just now starting to feel like fall: suddenly cool temperatures can make your vehicles’ tires lose pressure much more quickly than you might think. I thought it had to get below freezing and stay there for a day or two before this would happen, but I've learned (the sort of hard way, but fortunately not **too** hard way) it happens if you simply reach the mid-forties (F.) or so.*

At least here in the northern suburbs of Dallas, many of the retail areas seem to have standardized on [giant ball ornaments like these](https://moscadesign.com/giant-christmas-balls/), especially red ones, as the external decoration of choice for this year's holiday shopping season. Didn't get the memo but, then, I never do.

*[Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) no longer runs on this site. After comparing last May's "[Is Vendor Prefixing Dead?](https://css-tricks.com/is-vendor-prefixing-dead/)" with the CSS this site actually uses, I simply decided Autoprefixer had ceased to be necessary. (If you believe I'm being too hasty, please [let me know](/contact/).)*

It's only anecdotal evidence, but I'd say that, right now, Google's [YouTube TV](https://tv.youtube.com) streaming service has significant pixelation issues when running on at least some [Amazon Fire Sticks](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-fire-stick). Not surprisingly, the problem doesn't seem to be nearly as bad for [Chromecast with Google TV](https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US) devices. Note to self: file that under "Things that make you say, 'Hmm.’"

*If you're at a party with web developers who've been pried away from their coding, casually mention the term "[partial hydration](https://dev.to/ajcwebdev/what-is-partial-hydration-and-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it-3k56)” and watch their eyes light up. Just be sure you don't suggest it has something to do with not drinking enough water.*

Have recently been beta-testing the [Orion](https://browser.kagi.com/) web browser for macOS. Orion is an attempt to make a better version of Safari (write your own jokes), using the same [WebKit](https://webkit.org) engine. One particularly interesting aspect of Orion is that it actually [allows use of extensions for Chrome and Firefox](https://browser.kagi.com/faq.html#extensions).[^dog] There's also an iOS version in beta, but I haven't yet seen it.

[^dog]: Be advised that the support for those other extensions is pretty spotty for now. Still, as the saying goes: if you find a talking dog, don't criticize his grammar. The fact that Orion has **any** ability to use extensions built for other browser engines is pretty cool.

*[Flavio Copes](https://flaviocopes.com) switched to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)?!? "[Whoa, Nellie](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/keith-jackson-college-football-moments-rose-bowl-sugar-bowl-vince-young-bear-bryant-desmond-howard/14uwg0n95xmqn17etxbyem6lai)!”*
