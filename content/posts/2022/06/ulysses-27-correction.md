In my hurry to publish yesterday's "[Major updates to my favorite writing apps](/posts/2022/06/major-updates-my-favorite-writing-apps/)," I committed some errors concerning [Ulysses 27](https://ulysses.app/release-notes/). I have now fixed those, but wanted to issue this separate post for the sake of those who view my content only through their feed readers.

Today, I received the following very nice response from a Ulysses developer (name omitted, since I didn't ask in advance about quoting this dev by name):

> Thank you for your blog post reviewing the latest Ulysses update, we really appreciate it!
>
> I just have two notes which I thought would be helpful:
>
> - Ulysses is not macOS-only. We’ve also released Ulysses 27 on iOS, so you can use all table features on your iPhone or iPad as well.
> - Besides our own Markdown XL format, you can also add external folders containing plain Markdown files. You can add tables to these files as well – they’ll be stored as MultiMarkdown tables.

Yikes. Can't believe I missed the first one, since I've been using Ulysses on my Mac, iPhone, and iPad for **four years** now. I said, "macOS-only" (to distinguish from earlier references to [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), which is available on more OSs), but I really meant "Apple-only" or something to that effect.

As for the second item: that, I **didn't** know. But I do now.

Anyway, the original is now fixed accordingly.

Thank you, Ulysses developer, for the friendly corrections! I appreciate them and, of course, **tremendously** appreciate Ulysses itself --- on **all** my Apple gear.
