I’ve just written my first article for the [CloudCannon Blog](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/), entitled “[**Planning for your next Hugo project**](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/planning-for-your-next-hugo-project/).”

In case you don’t know, [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com) is a **[Git](https://git-scm.com)-powered** content management system (CMS), which makes it a great fit for not only [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) but also a growing number of other [static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) (SSGs).

If you have any interest whatsoever in Hugo — and especially if you’re building (or considering building) a Hugo-based website for a client — please [give the article a look](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/planning-for-your-next-hugo-project/). Thanks in advance! (Also, be sure to check out the other articles on the CloudCannon Blog. These folks really “get” SSG-built websites.)
