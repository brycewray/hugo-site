*(With apologies to the late John&nbsp;Lennon and the very much still-with-us Sir&nbsp;Paul&nbsp;McCartney. [Original lyrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_I'm_Sixty-Four) &copy; Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC.*)

Long before aging,\
I lost my hair\
Many years ago,\
So there's no point belaboring that\
Or hiding it by wearing a hat.

Quarter past three is\
About when I wake.\
[I can't sleep much more](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/aging-and-sleep).\
That's just the way\
My life goes these days:\
Now I'm sixty-four.

I'm still a tech nerd,\
Although some folks my age\
[Struggle to use Word](https://www.dummies.com/software/microsoft-office/office-2019-for-seniors-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/).

When my employer's\
Websites need work,\
Or when my own does, too,\
I'm just glad that I can still code\
And that I still "get" Admin mode.

Building `do-while` [loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while), editing [styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS):\
Who could ask for more?\
That's why work needs me\
And it still feeds me\
Though I'm sixty-four.

Getting older is a thing you have to do\
In the course of life. That's just the deal.\
But it's not all bad.\
Now a grandchild's on the way:\
A little lass or lad.

Thrilled with such good news,\
I've reached this day,\
Awaiting things to come,\
Knowing that a tiny face soon will see me\
And wonder just who I may be.

"Kid, I'm your grandpa," I will explain.\
"Will be, forevermore."\
And on this birthday,\
Yes, sir, I do say:\
Now I'm sixty-four.
