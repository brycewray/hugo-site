After this site went to [cut-the-crap-and-just-write (CTCAJW) Mode](/posts/2022/05/simplify-simplify-maybe-for-real-this-time/), I suddenly wrote here more frequently --- several days in a row, including **twice** in one day (which I'd never done before). While I truly had topics worth covering, the more likely cause of this sudden flood was the greater freedom that, as I'd hoped it would, CTCAJW Mode has allowed me.

And, yet, the proliferation of posts posed a potential problem. (P'shaw.)

Now, I worried, I'd quickly annoy people by posting to social media *every time* I issued a new post, as had been my practice since pretty much the earliest days of the site. Back when I'd sometimes gone weeks between posts, that hadn't mattered; but *virtually daily*? Nah. Spamming ["R" not us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toys_%22R%22_Us).

So, then, I decided to ask people to subscribe to my site's RSS and JSON feeds. This request now takes the form of a pinned tweet on my Twitter profile and pinned toots on my profiles on my most frequently visited [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) instances.

Still, that left out people who don't use feeds *yet* might find interest in some of the subjects about which I write. A Venn diagram of non-feed users and My Potential Readers will show a much larger overlap than we who *do* use feeds would care to consider.

What to do?

The solution I reached was this post or, more correctly, the series it begins today: "**The site this week**."

Within each week's entry, I'll list/link the site's posts for the previous seven days[^notThis] **and** then tell social media about **this** one. I hope that'll be a good compromise.

[^notThis]: Of course, that won't usually count a week's edition of this new series, except perhaps only next week's edition, when we look back on this very first one as the defining edition thereof.

So that's the origin story for this series.

Now, let's see what spewed forth from here in the last week.
