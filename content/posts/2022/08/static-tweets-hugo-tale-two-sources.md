## Deprecation notice, 2022-11-06

Due to changes in the status and/or availability of one or more Twitter APIs, perhaps due to the many corporate changes at Twitter itself following its purchase by Elon Musk, I have deprecated several posts, or sections thereof, concerning the fully static embedding of tweets within one's website. **However**, if you still wish to see the final pre-deprecation form of this post, it remains accessible [in the site's GitHub repo](https://github.com/brycewray/hugo-site/blob/main/.deprecated/content/posts/2022/08/static-tweets-hugo-tale-two-sources.md).
