Those who are trying to figure out the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators) (SSG) can run into trouble when they seek help on the only official source *for* that help, the [Hugo Discourse forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io).

Now, don't get me wrong: if you follow the ["Requesting Help" guidelines](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/requesting-help/9132), you absolutely can get powerful help on the Hugo Discourse; but there are times when someone simply *can't* adhere to those guidelines for some reason, yet still needs help with Hugo.[^grumpy] And that's probably the best reason for the continued existence of the definitely *non*-official **[Hugo Community Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/JUvtfrHBzG)**.[^invLink]

[^grumpy]: When you see the Hugo Discourse described as (*e.g.*) "grumpy" within online discussions in sites like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), it's often due to the tone of responses such cases have historically tended to receive, particularly from certain participants --- some of whom, to be fair, are no longer active on this Discourse, although many if not most of their acid-tongued answers are still visible within archived threads.

[^invLink]: That's an invite link that should last for a while, unlike most Discord invite links; h/t [dylan-k](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/kindly-join-my-discord-server-for-hugo/34074/8).

It's a place where you can jump into a live chat session and ask a question or describe a problem you're having with the Hugo SSG. As of this writing, the Discord server doesn't get a lot of traffic, largely **because** it's non-official and, thus, not linked from Hugo's own site and docs as is the official Discourse forum. Nonetheless, the Discord server can be a good resource when/if you need it. There are multiple long-time Hugo users who monitor what traffic it does get, try very hard to treat newcomers nicely, and (if/when possible) will offer help to those who request it.

Interested? [Check it out](https://discord.com/invite/JUvtfrHBzG).[^invLink] Signing up is free, there are no obligations whatsoever to use it once you've signed up, you can come and go as you please, and --- best of all --- it might just be the quickest and most painless way to get an answer to a nagging question about Hugo.
