This site and its owner **do NOT** store your personal information **in any way**. However, the site does use certain **externally hosted** services, each of which has its own privacy policies and methods of complying with applicable privacy regulations.

## Notes about external services

### Cloudflare Browser Insights

This site's traffic goes through [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) and is configured to use its Browser Insights tool. Cloudflare says Browser Insights "collects the bare minimum amount of information, timing metrics, to show customers how their websites perform" and that "Cloudflare does not track individual end-users *[sic]* across our customers' Internet properties." For more details, see [this Cloudflare support article](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033929991-Cloudflare-Browser-Insights) and the Cloudflare blog post, "[Introducing Browser Insights](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-browser-insights/)."

### Fathom Analytics

This site uses [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com), which [does not store your personal data in any way](https://usefathom.com/blog/anonymization). Please refer also to my article, "[Fathom Analytics: count on it](/posts/2020/06/fathom-analytics-count-on-it)."

### Google Fonts

When I learned that the use of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) *served from* Google will transmit a visitor's apparently **not** anonymized IP address[^Issue1495] to Google, I quit using this product (and suggesting to others that they use it) and, instead, served from my own site any typefaces that aren't part of the so-called "[system fonts stack](/posts/2018/10/web-typography-part-2)."

[^Issue1495]: For the discussion that convinced me to go this route after my initial skepticism about its necessity, see the Google Fonts GitHub issue, "[GDPR compliance](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/1495)."

## Other considerations

### Embedded videos

I no longer embed YouTube or other sites’ videos, since they can and do transmit personal information through cookies. In the two instances where I formerly did---“[Some curmudgeonish thoughts](/posts/2018/11/some-curmudgeonish-thoughts)” and “[Coherence and COVID-19](/posts/2020/03/coherence-covid-19)”---I replaced them with clearly identified links to their original locations, and footnoted each link with a reference and link to this privacy policy.

### Twitter content

I do not *embed* tweets, since doing so makes the embedded tweets transmit personal information through cookies. Instead, each tweet is shown as a screen capture linked to its original location. For accessibility-respecting purposes, each such screen capture has a plain-text version of the tweet's content in its [ALT attribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute).
