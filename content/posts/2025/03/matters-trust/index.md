It can be unsettling to recognize just how much trust that software vendors expect us to place in their wares. The same can occur when, having given that level of trust, we find ourselves perhaps wishing we hadn't. The last few weeks have provided for our examination two key cases in point: the Mozilla Firefox Terms of Use (TOU) SNAFU and the purchase of Strongbox.

## The Firefox TOU controversy

Mozilla issued two significant blog posts near the end of February, 2025: "[Introducing a terms of use and updated privacy notice for Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-news/firefox-terms-of-use/)" and, two days later, "[An update on our Terms of Use](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/update-on-terms-of-use/)." As the second post's title suggests, the first post had provoked an avalanche of questions and concerns from the browser-watching community, but the second post helped little or not at all in stemming the flow of worries.

There was sufficient drama surrounding all this that I suspect you've already read and/or seen plenty about it, so I'll avoid adding to it here. If you need additional context, just search for something like *Firefox Terms of Use controversy* and I suspect you'll get more results --- with, yes, a goodly mixture of opinions and sometimes well-founded comments --- than you could hope to see. Suffice it to say these posts (and the resulting drama) shocked the increasingly small bloc of Firefox users, as well as those non-Firefox users who'd nonetheless wished the browser well in its quest to survive in a world trending toward domination by Chrome and Chromium.

Mozilla shed a ton of good will, not to mention much of the trust of Firefox's previously most loyal users, with both these actions and Mozilla's attempts at explaining them. Just exactly why Mozilla felt it necessary to make the changes is the key, I think, but at this writing we don't know the answer to that. It comes down to which kind of legal exposure that the language in the TOU and the updated Privacy Notice was intended to prevent: *i.e.*, was it to protect Mozilla regarding data-selling it **already** had been doing, or data-selling it **was planning** to do? Neither is a good look for a company and browser which have long proudly presented themselves as privacy-friendly.

## Selling Strongbox to Applause --- but not applause

Until a few days ago, security-minded Apple device users looking for [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)-compatible password management software could safely select the Strongbox app for macOS and iOS. That changed with the [announcement](https://strongboxsafe.com/strongbox-joins-applause/) that [Applause](https://www.applause.dev) was buying Strongbox. Online communities of Strongbox users almost uniformly said they felt betrayed by this takeover of the app. (For example, check [this Reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/strongbox/comments/1jaljzn/strongbox_was_taken_over_by_the_company_applause/).)

The particularly sensitive nature of the data one entrusts to a password management app only magnified these users' outrage over the idea that Strongbox would now be in the hands of an entity which they hadn't selected and didn't want, *especially* one which has been known for (among other things) adding "phone-home" analytics to other apps it's acquired. Moreover: unlike some other KeePass-compatible apps, Strongbox is not completely open-source, so "ah, just fork it and move on" isn't an option even for those willing and technically able to go that route.

## Ah, life

As I [wrote](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2025/01/mixed-nuts-14/) a couple of months ago:

> . . . I increasingly realize and reluctantly accept that most of my choices in life are from among products and services controlled by really nasty people and/or entities . . .

. . . but, that said, I also increasingly realize and reluctantly accept that, from time to time, it'll turn out that previously trusted entities and tools either are no longer worthy of that trust or, in fact, may never have been so in the first place. That's life, I guess.
