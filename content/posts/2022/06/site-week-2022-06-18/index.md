**Note**: To avoid spamming social media *every* time I issue a post, I use each entry in this series to list what I've published since the previous "The site this week" post. (Then, I promote **this**.)
{.box}

Here are my posts from this past week . . .

*Interested in more efficient CSS for your site? Hugo doesn't make it easy, but here's a suggested way you might get there.*

*It took Apple a while to get it (maybe) right --- but it's "so far, so good" on something announced at last year's WWDC.*

- <span class="sansSerif"><strong class="pokey">2022-06-15</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[IE's dead, Jim](/posts/2022/06/ies-dead-jim/)\
