I deactivated my Twitter account nearly two weeks ago, following the [completion of Elon Musk's purchase of the platform](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/). Only a few days later, I reactivated it ([you get 30 days before the deactivation is final](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-twitter-account)) so my Developer account, too, would be active and I could try to determine the reasons behind what I wrote about in "[Static tweets: the deprecation](/posts/2022/11/static-tweets-deprecation/)."

I then kept the account open for a few days, especially during the period surrounding this year's U.S. elections, but used it only to lurk. My last tweet there had been from right before I first deactivated the account, as I mentioned [downloading my data](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive) in preparation for "evacuation."

Finally, yesterday, amid [this week's rising tide of chaos](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/tech/twitter-chaos-musk) involving what are expected to be Twitter's massive security and maintenance problems --- especially those traceable to the after-effects of ongoing key firings, layoffs, and resignations --- I decided to deactivate the account again, and this time for good.[^brand]

[^brand]:  I will add that quite a few folks out there in InternetzLand urged keeping one's account active, even if unused, to avoid someone else's later being able to "squat" on the now-abandoned Twitter handle. However, I'm no "brand" or "name," so anyone who might end up with my old Twitter handle, `BryceWrayTX`, will find it an empty vessel.

That ended eleven years of Twitter use under two different accounts. The original lived (under me, anyway) 2011--2014, while my final one began as a mainly-for-business-stuff account in 2014 and evolved gradually in 2015 into a just-for-me account, which it remained until its deactivation yesterday.

<strong class="red">Update, 2022-11-22</strong>: After further research and consultation with others whose judgments I trust, I have reactivated **but [locked](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-make-twitter-private)** the Twitter account. This is despite my ongoing concerns about [Twitter's resilience](https://twitterisgoinggreat.com/) in the wake of additional departures (voluntary or otherwise) of particularly significant sets of the company's employees, and those concerns may lead me back to a true deactivation down the line.\

I will further update this post as appropriate.
