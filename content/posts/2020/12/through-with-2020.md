Back during some of the anti-war activities of the 1960s, detractors of U.S. President Lyndon Johnson's policies in Vietnam would chant or sing this about him, borrowing from a protest song by activist/musician Pete Seeger:

> We're waist deep in the Big Muddy<br />
> And the big fool says to push on.[^legalWDITBM]

[^legalWDITBM]: "Waist Deep in the Big Muddy" by Pete Seeger. Lyrics &copy; T.R.O., Inc.

This entire, cursed year of 2020 has felt like the Biggest Muddy of all.

Let's hope that, a year from now, we don't look back on 2021 and say it was merely a continuation of the agonizing 2020. The result of the world's efforts to limit or end the [COVID-19 pandemic](/posts/2020/03/coherence-covid-19/) could be the primary determinant thereof, but there are other dark clouds out there through which we'll need to navigate.

And, with those cheery thoughts, I segue to offering you a review of this site's posts for 2020 --- or, if you will, what *this* big fool was saying while we all tried to get to the point where we are now, which is, finally, *through* this particular Big Muddy.

---

## January

- **[Two cheers for Tailwind](/posts/2020/01/two-cheers-tailwind/)** --- Got my first taste of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and didn't care much for it. Changed my mind a few months later, though.
- **[Streamers’ party](/posts/2020/01/streamers-party/)** --- Finally gave up cable TV and became a cord-cutter after finding a way to do so without antagonizing my tech-phobic spouse.

## February

- **[So much for heroes](/posts/2020/02/so-much-for-heroes/)** --- Gave up on "hero images" for a while, after thrashing around with the bizarreness of web images. Would later relent after I realized I *missed* those big pretty pictures.
- **[Mixed nuts • February, 2020](/posts/2020/02/mixed-nuts-february-2020/)** --- This was the second in what has become a series of even more random observations than I *usually* spew.
- **[YouTube TV and the RSNs flap](/posts/2020/02/youtube-tv-rsns-flap/)** --- Discussed a growing dilemma within pro sports. (Of course, within a couple of weeks, I saw that pro sports was going to have a *lot* more to worry about in 2020.)

## March

- **[Welcome, sweet little early bird](/posts/2020/03/welcome-sweet-little-early-bird/)** --- Your faithful correspondent's first grandchild arrived.
- **[Some Sirius(XM) thoughts](/posts/2020/03/some-siriusxm-thoughts/)** --- After a new vehicle purchase presented my first-ever access to satellite radio, I pondered the pros and cons thereof.
- **[Coherence and COVID-19](/posts/2020/03/coherence-covid-19/)** --- Offered my early thoughts as the COVID-19 menace took over the world's attention, damaged its economy, and altered my own daily existence.
- **[Back to Nunjucks for my Eleventy site](/posts/2020/03/back-nunjucks-eleventy-site/)** --- Discussed my first, and abortive, dip in the waters of JavaScript-only (`.11ty.js`) templating in the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators) (SSG) about which I'd write so frequently in the succeeding months. I'd soon give that templating another shot, with greater success.

## April

- **[Different modes for different code](/posts/2020/04/different-modes-different-code/)** --- Described the first of what became multiple efforts to help others get a better feel for how SSGs work.
- **[The full .11ty.js monty](/posts/2020/04/full-11ty-js-monty/)** --- Went full-JavaScript as far as the site's templating was concerned.
- **[Murdered darlings](/posts/2020/04/murdered-darlings/)** --- Temporarily gave up on the novel I've been trying to write since 2017 (and, with it, the [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) writing app).
- **Webmentions in three SSGs** --- Did a five-part series on how to include [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) in one's website. [Part 1](/posts/2020/04/webmentions-three-ssgs-1/) was the intro; [Part 2](/posts/2020/04/webmentions-three-ssgs-2/) explained how to add webmentions to an Eleventy site; [Part 3](/posts/2020/04/webmentions-three-ssgs-3/), same for a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site; [Part 4](/posts/2020/04/webmentions-three-ssgs-4/), same for a [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) site; and [Part 5](/posts/2020/04/webmentions-three-ssgs-5/) wrapped it up with a bibliography of all the great articles on which I'd relied in writing the series.

## May

- **[Going solo with Eleventy](/posts/2020/05/going-solo-eleventy/)** --- Decided that my site *didn't* need [webpack](https://webpack.js.org), after all, despite what I'd [written the previous December](/posts/2019/12/packing-up/), and switched to a setup that was much simpler to maintain *but* also once again included Tailwind CSS.
- **[Battle of the iOS email heavyweights](/posts/2020/05/battle-ios-email-heavyweights/)** --- Reviewed the [AltaMail](https://mobile.eurosmartz.com/products/altamail.html) and [Preside](https://preside.io/) iOS email client apps, sort of following up on my [2019 drive-by](/posts/2019/06/ahoy-mate/) of the incredibly full-featured [MailMate](https://freron.com) email client app for macOS.
- **[Mixed nuts • May, 2020](/posts/2020/05/mixed-nuts-2020-05/)** --- And the random takes just kept on coming.
- **[A thousand words, indeed](/posts/2020/05/thousand-words-indeed/)** --- Wherein I brought back those "hero images" I'd bleep-canned back in February, and explained why.

## June

- **[Why I kept Ulysses](/posts/2020/06/why-kept-ulysses/)** --- Following up on "[Murdered darlings](/posts/2020/04/murdered-darlings/)," I explained why I not only *wasn't* giving up on Ulysses but also *wasn't* deep-sixing the attempt at a novel.
- **[Fathom Analytics: Count on it](/posts/2020/06/fathom-analytics-count-on-it/)** --- Dumped other website analytics products in favor of what I'd found to be the [cream of the crop](https://usefathom.com/ref/ZKHYWX) (affiliate link) where respecting the *privacy* of one's visitors is concerned.
- **[O say can you CI/CD?](/posts/2020/06/o-say-can-you-ci-cd/)** --- Provided ways for [Netlify](https://netlify.com) users (at that time, I was one of ’em) to get around the 300-minute monthly build limit on that web host's free tier.


## July

- **[Goodbye and hello](/posts/2020/07/goodbye-hello/)** --- Examined the merits of several SSG-friendly hosts’ free tiers and moved the site to what I pronounced the top dog in that bunch, [Vercel](https://vercel.com). However, as you'll see, this was only the start of what I would subsequently call "the lurch" among various hosts.
- **[Stacks and stacks](/posts/2020/07/stacks-and-stacks/)** --- Compared the site's "tech stack" from exactly a year before with what it was using on the date I initially posted this.

- **[Chasing 100: Tips for optimizing your website](/posts/2020/07/chasing-100-tips-optimizing-website/)** --- Suggested performance-enhancement methods (I'll forego the obvious snarky comment).
- **[Beginner's luck](/posts/2020/07/beginners-luck/)** --- Continued trying to help SSG newbies (because I'd been one not so long ago), this time with starter sets for both Eleventy and Hugo.
- **[Transformed](/posts/2020/07/transformed/)** --- Finally reached the end of my patience with *locally* managing/prrocessing site images and, instead, transferred that aggravation to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/dqunpyaeqiizezj6lbdu) (that's an "invitation link," as explained in an update to the article).
- **[Goodbye and hello • Part 2](/posts/2020/07/goodbye-hello-part-2/)** --- "Lurched" back to Netlify from Vercel. Briefly.

## August

- **[Posting with Ulysses](/posts/2020/08/posting-with-ulysses/)** --- Out of curiosity, went back for a while to Ulysses, rather than [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), as the posting app of record.
- **[Google Fonts and privacy](/posts/2020/08/google-fonts-privacy/)** --- Explained why using Google Fonts, if served *by* Google, violates the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) and, in general, disrespects the privacy of one's visitors. Then, in a follow-up piece&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
- **[Good stuff without Google](/posts/2020/08/good-stuff-without-google/)** ---  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I provided steps for obtaining Google Fonts and then providing them to your visitors *without* using Google's *servers*.

- **[Goodbye and hello • Part 4](/posts/2020/09/goodbye-hello-part-4/)** --- Moved the site to [Render](https://render.com). Briefly.
- **[Goodbye and hello • Part 5](/posts/2020/09/goodbye-hello-part-5/)** --- Ended my *overt* discussion of "the lurch" with a departure from Render after I saw I hadn't quite done my homework.
- **[Two, but not terrible](/posts/2020/09/two-but-not-terrible/)** --- Commemorated the site's second birthday.
- **[A normal person's guide to static websites](/posts/2020/09/normal-persons-guide-static-websites/)** --- Reached out to *non*-geeks (*i.e.*, people unlike Yours Truly) in the first of two articles; in this one, I explained static websites and SSGs themselves, after which&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
- **[A normal person's guide to static website hosting](/posts/2020/09/normal-persons-guide-static-website-hosting/)** --- .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I offered opinions on the best places for a non-geek to place his/her static website if he/she did, indeed, decide to have one in the first place.
- **[Ignition sequence start](/posts/2020/09/ignition-sequence-start/)** --- (Back to geekism for geekism's sake.) Provided [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for deploying a site to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).

## October

## November

- **[Curmudgeonish thoughts for 2020](/posts/2020/11/curmudgeonish-thoughts-2020/)** --- Provided my third annual rant about pet peeves. Yes, even in 2020.
- **[Mixed nuts • November, 2020](/posts/2020/11/mixed-nuts-2020-11/)** --- Perhaps gave new meaning to the phrase *various and sundry*.
- **[Using PostCSS for cache-busting in Eleventy](/posts/2020/11/using-postcss-cache-busting-eleventy/)** --- Made what turned out to be the first of two tries to help Eleventy users with caching of their CSS files; soon had to give it another shot when I discovered glitchiness I'd missed the first time around.
- **[What Apple Silicon means for web developers](/posts/2020/11/what-apple-silicon-means-web-developers/)** --- Suggested the early (and warranted) excitement over the new Macs didn't quite yet point to nirvana for web devs.
- **[Fast but flawed](/posts/2020/11/fast-but-flawed/)** --- Tested two more static website hosting platforms and found that each has great performance but also (what I consider to be) a show-stopper.

## December

- **[Cache-busting in Eleventy, take two](/posts/2020/12/cache-busting-eleventy-take-two/)** --- Tried to *mea-culpa*-ize my way out of the problem in "[Using PostCSS for cache-busting in Eleventy](/posts/2020/11/using-postcss-cache-busting-eleventy/)" with a different solution, one based on bespoke code. When I got questions about the specifics, that led to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
- **[Hashing out a cache-busting fix for Eleventy](/posts/2020/12/hashing-out-cache-busting-fix-eleventy/)** --- .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wherein I went into more detail, including providing the code itself rather than just tossing off links about it.
- **[Gems in the rough](/posts/2020/12/gems-in-rough/)** --- Passed along a few helpful (?) nuggets of info about managing a static website.
- **[Eleventy and Hugo: Comparing and contrasting](/posts/2020/12/eleventy-hugo-comparing-contrasting/)** --- Suggested how one might choose between the two SSGs I'd [previously recommended](/posts/2020/09/normal-persons-guide-static-websites/) as "best-in-show."

And that's how we passed through 2020 in this site. Perhaps you found at least some of the articles helpful, enlightening, and/or even somewhat amusing, especially in these damnably difficult times in which we're living.

Please accept my wishes that, for you and yours, 2021 will be a gigantic improvement over its universally despised predecessor. Stay safe, stay well, and --- always --- thank you for stopping by my little site.
