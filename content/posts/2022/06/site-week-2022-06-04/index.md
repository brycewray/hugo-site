**Note**: To avoid spamming social media *every* time I issue a post, I use each entry in this series to list what I've published since the previous "The site this week" post. (Then, I promote **this**.)

Here are my posts from this past week . . .

- [The site this week: 2022-05-28](/posts/2022/05/site-week-2022-05-28/)\
*[It was the first entry of this series, which is the only reason why I show it here. Future "The site this week" posts won't list their predecessors.]*

- <span class="sansSerif"><strong class="pokey">2022-05-29</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[The IndieWeb experiment ends](/posts/2022/05/indieweb-experiment-ends/)\
*My timing wasn't the greatest.*

- <span class="sansSerif"><strong class="pokey">2022-05-30</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Fun with feeds](/posts/2022/05/fun-with-feeds/)\
*Cut through the clutter by following various feeds.*

- <span class="sansSerif"><strong class="pokey">2022-06-01</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Get good Git Info from Hugo](/posts/2022/06/get-good-git-info-hugo/)\
*It's easy to fetch and display your Hugo repo's Git data.*

- <span class="sansSerif"><strong class="pokey">2022-06-03</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Static Mastodon toots in Hugo](/posts/2022/06/static-mastodon-toots-hugo/)\
*Just like tweet embeds, toot embeds are best when they're purely static.*

**Plug**: Want to know whenever I issue a post? **Follow the feed** (choose [RSS](/index.xml) or [JSON](/index.json)).
