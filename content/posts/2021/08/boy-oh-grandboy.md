We found out last Christmas Day that [our granddaughter, Kennedy Beck](/posts/2020/03/welcome-sweet-little-early-bird), was going to be a big sister this summer. Then, on Valentine's Day and just before millions of Texans (including yours truly) were plunged into a power grid meltdown in the midst of a fierce winter storm, we learned the new arrival would be a boy.

At 2:55 PM this past Monday, that boy---all six pounds, 10 ounces of Dylan Everett Beck---came into the world. He went home the next afternoon and, at last report, the members of the newly expanded family all were doing very well.

Incidentally: as I [recently mentioned](/posts/2021/08/gems-in-rough-08), I've been paying close attention to the new [Astro](https://astro.build) static site generator and running some tests with it, so I've filed a few issues in its GitHub repository. When it became obvious that Dylan's birth was going to happen **soon**, I responded to one issue's proposed solution to say that I "will have to wait a while before I can try it, however --- my daughter is in the process of delivering our second grandchild." To my delight, this got mentioned on the Astro Discord community, whereupon I was greeted with a slew of congratulatory comments (and accompanying emojis) that I shared with Dylan's proud parents:
