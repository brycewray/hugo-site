This should be the last word on the subject of where my custom domains' email will "live" going forward. Really. Pinky-swear. *Et cetera*.

In my [most recent post about this topic](/posts/2022/09/using-icloud-mail-custom-domain-retreat/), a few weeks ago, I summarized how I'd explored it since Apple had enabled [iCloud+](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/icloud-overview-mmfc854d9604/icloud) subscribers such as I to host their custom-domain(s)-based email on iCloud Mail. However, my (seeming) end point had been that I'd be sticking with [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com), instead. Although this would mean I'd be paying both the monthly iCloud+ charge and the $50/year[^inflation] for Fastmail, I found that acceptable because of the apparent technical superiority of Fastmail over iCloud Mail.

[^inflation]: At least, it's $50/year as of this post's initial publication date. When/whether the current inflationary times will change that, I don't know.

However, as an old [retired](/posts/2021/09/transition/) guy who has to watch his pennies carefully, I reconsidered that A/B choice over the ensuing weeks and, this past weekend, decided to save the fifty bucks by going with iCloud Mail, other niceties be damned. After all, to quote a line attributed to [Artemus Ward](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Artemus_Ward): "When a fellow says it ain't the money but the principle of the thing, it's the money."

One thing that would help iCloud Mail greatly would be the adoption of the impressive [JMAP protocol](https://fastmail.blog/open-technologies/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/) that Fastmail uses. Although [JMAP is now an open standard](https://jmap.io/spec.html), I have no idea whether adopting and implementing JMAP is even a topic for discussion within Apple.

In any event: my annual Fastmail subscription has only a month to go as I write this, so the likelihood of my doing a double-/triple-/quadruple-reverse flip back to that provider is fading fast. Besides, I just spent four days once again laboriously copying thousands of old emails from Fastmail to iCloud Mail, and I didn't do so lightly, having *already* done it enough this year that I knew what a pain it would be. And it was.

Yep, Artemus, you were right: it's the money.
