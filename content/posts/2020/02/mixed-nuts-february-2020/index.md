The world didn't end when I issued the [inaugural set of Mixed Nuts](/posts/2019/11/mixed-nuts-2019-11/) so, while that's hardly a proof of the wisdom of Going There again, I figure: hey, why not? With that ringing endorsement from your humble host, here goes nothing (which may be truer than I'd like to believe).

-------

This hoary, old boomer has studiously avoided addressing the "OK, boomer" phenomenon. He shall continue to do so.

*If you're in the market for a 2020-model SUV, I can highly endorse the Honda CR-V EX. Seems pretty much the best mix of features and value in the line.*

One benefit I didn't expect from the [streaming](/posts/2020/01/streamers-party/) experience: being able to find and store so many items in the [YouTube TV](https://tv.youtube.com) cloud DVD has let me introduce my wife to [wonderful](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025878/) [old](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040613/) [movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032904/) she'd never seen before. I love seeing her enjoy them on her first views as much as I long have on my many repeated viewings.

*It never fails to amaze me when I view the source code of some elaborate-looking commercial website and see it was built on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org). Are these people totally unaware of the advantages, notably the cost savings and improved security, of [static site generators](https://staticgen.com)?*

One thing I did *not* expect to occur when I made [this site's repository](https://github.com/brycewray/eleventy_bundler) [public](/posts/2019/12/code-comfort-eleventy-webpack/) was that it would get GitHub stars. At this writing, the quantity is still in the single digits but, hey, man, it's actual *Github stars*. We Are Not Worthy.

*For those reviewers out there who believe you can't do long-form writing in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) because it requires you to rename individual chapters’ files when you want to move around scenes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.* **Really**?

I long in vain for a return to the days when athletes *did not* engage in elaborate celebrations after every frigging accomplishment during a game[^Volleyball]. Celebrate when you win, folks --- maybe (*i.e.*, if the win doesn't simply advance you to a .350 record).

[^Volleyball]: This extends even to *NCAA volleyball*, for God's sake. High-fiving after *every point*?!? Man alive.

*I shudder for those of my long-ago colleagues who are still in the terrestrial radio business. Between satellite radio and the ease of adding one's own music to a typical automobile sound system, how in the* world *can those folks compete, long-term?*

Although I have nearly a year to go on my current subscription with [1Password](https://1password.com), have been impressed so far while trying out the open-source but fully featured [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com). If you're trying to sort out your own passwords, I strongly urge you to give Bitwarden a try.

*Seeing how so many prominent individuals, institutions, and teams have succeeded by cheating and otherwise flouting the rules, perhaps society should just* eliminate *all rules and cut out the ineffective middleman. We could call this the "Systematic Correction and Repeal of Egregious Works’ Interference via Total Annihilation of Limiting Legislation" (SCREWITALL).*
