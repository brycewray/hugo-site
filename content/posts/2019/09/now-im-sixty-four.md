*(With apologies to the late John&nbsp;Lennon and the very much still-with-us Sir&nbsp;Paul&nbsp;McCartney. [Original lyrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_I'm_Sixty-Four) &copy; Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC.*)

Long before aging,  
I lost my hair  
Many years ago,  
So there's no point belaboring that  
Or hiding it by wearing a hat.

Quarter past three is  
About when I wake.  
[I can't sleep much more](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/aging-and-sleep).  
That's just the way  
My life goes these days:  
Now I'm sixty-four.

I'm still a tech nerd,  
Although some folks my age  
[Struggle to use Word](https://www.dummies.com/software/microsoft-office/office-2019-for-seniors-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/).

When my employer's  
Websites need work,  
Or when my own does, too,  
I'm just glad that I can still code  
And that I still "get" Admin mode.

Building `do-while` [loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while), editing [styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS):  
Who could ask for more?  
That's why work needs me  
And it still feeds me  
Though I'm sixty-four.

Getting older is a thing you have to do  
In the course of life. That's just the deal.  
But it's not all bad.  
Now a grandchild's on the way:  
A little lass or lad.

Thrilled with such good news,  
I've reached this day,  
Awaiting things to come,   
Knowing that a tiny face soon will see me  
And wonder just who I may be.

"Kid, I'm your grandpa," I will explain.  
"Will be, forevermore."  
And on this birthday,  
Yes, sir, I do say:  
Now I'm sixty-four.
