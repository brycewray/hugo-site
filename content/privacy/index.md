This site and its owner **do NOT** store your personal information **in any way**. However, the site does use certain **external services**, each of which has its own privacy policies and methods of complying with applicable privacy regulations.

## Cloudflare

This site is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) and is configured to use Cloudflare's Web Analytics tool, which [Cloudflare claims](https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-first-web-analytics/) doesn’t track individual users and doesn’t leave cookies.

## Fathom Analytics

This site uses [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com), which [does not store your personal data in any way](https://usefathom.com/blog/anonymization). Please refer also to my article, "[Fathom Analytics: count on it](/posts/2020/06/fathom-analytics-count-on-it/)."

## Mastodon

This site reproduces [Mastodon](https://join.mastodon.org) toots as purely static text and downloaded images with no tracking involved. Each toot is linked to its original location on the applicable Mastodon instance.

## YouTube

This site uses [lite-youtube-embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed) to provide [YouTube](https://youtube.com) embeds that respect your privacy. For details concerning how this works, see Sia Karamalegos's article, "[Faster YouTube embeds in Eleventy](https://sia.codes/posts/lite-youtube-embed-eleventy/)," on which this site's related templating is based.
