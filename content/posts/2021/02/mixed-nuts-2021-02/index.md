A reader who [made contact with me](/contact/) recently told me my writing style seems very stream-of-consciousness[^compliment] --- to which I mused inwardly, "Well, if you think that about my *regular* stuff, wait ’til you read one of my 'Mixed nuts’ posts.”

[^compliment]: To be fair, he followed it up with a wonderful compliment (that I didn't deserve), but I felt the excerpt I used here was more appropriate to this series of posts.

More to the point, friends, **you** are about to have that, uh, opportunity, as we commence with the seventh in the series.

Although I [gave up](/posts/2021/02/simplify-simplify/) using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), I'm still happily using the [Tailwind `font-family` selections](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family), only now in my own [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com). For serif type, the default is [`ui-serif`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family). As of this writing, `ui-serif` is supported only on Safari, where it brings up the modern form of [Apple's New York font](https://www.creativebloq.com/news/new-york-font). I say "modern form" because we Mac old-timers remember [the 1980s version](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/31775/new-york-1984).[^InterVF]

[^InterVF]: **Update, 2021-02-15**: The lone exception is that, for sans-serif, I re-added the variable form of [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) as the initial font, preferring a more consistent cross-platform look.

*Incoming this August: grandchild #2, conferring upon [grandchild #1](/posts/2020/03/welcome-sweet-little-early-bird/) the high and exalted status of Big Sister and [all the rights and privileges pertaining thereto](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/41735/what-are-all-the-rights-and-privileges-pertaining-thereto).*[^reveal]

[^reveal]: **Update, 2021-02-14**: The next day after I posted this, we learned grandchild #2 will be a boy.

Incoming soon to one of my arms: shot #1 of the [COVID-19](/posts/2020/03/coherence-covid-19/) vaccine. As of this writing, I'm scheduled to get it on the morning of February 17 about ten miles from home, but the weather forecast for then is pretty nasty. Still: if I **can** get there that morning, you can bet I will.

*To repeat my update to my recent article, "[Beta-testing Cloudflare Pages](/posts/2021/01/beta-testing-cloudflare-pages/)," since the initial post really slammed the [platform](https://pages.cloudflare.com)'s build speeds:*

> ***Update, 2021-02-12**: Yesterday afternoon, Cloudflare pushed a change that dramatically cut the **total** build times. For a newer Hugo-based test site I’ve put on Cloudflare Pages, build now happens in about 45 seconds. While this is still slower than several of the competitors, the trend is definitely in the right direction.*

**Gaming-on-Macs, thought #1.** You may want to wait until macOS supports the newest set of Xbox controllers ([macOS 11.3, now in beta, adds that support](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/02/apple-seeds-macos-big-sur-11-3-beta-1/)), if the Xbox layout is to your liking as it is to mine.

***Gaming-on-Macs, thought #2.** If you choose the [SteelSeries Nimbus+](https://steelseries.com/gaming-controllers/nimbus-plus) controller, you **must immediately**  update its firmware (or it will brick itself within days), and the only way to do it from a Mac is to connect it via a Lightning cable and use the **Windows 10** version of the SteelSeries Engine software running in [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/). As of this writing, the **Mac** version of Engine is unable to detect the Nimbus+, even though it's been nearly a year since the controller debuted.*
