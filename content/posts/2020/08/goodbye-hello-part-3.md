Perhaps by now you've read how I [moved the site](/posts/2020/07/goodbye-hello-part-2/) back to [Netlify](https://netlify.com), its long-time home, following the [initial move](/posts/2020/07/goodbye-hello/) to [Vercel](https://vercel.com). If so, you know it was largely a sentimental decision, born out of my having missed being a part, even if a small one, of the Netlify community.

Well, that's nice and all, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I undid the undoing today and **returned** the site to Vercel.[^fastReturn]

[^fastReturn]: Since I was going back off Netlify DNS to Google DNS, the return was stunningly quicker than the earlier move the other way --- as in, minutes rather than hours.

Why?

- It's not exactly a "need for speed" thing, but I'm impressed by how considerably Vercel has [amped up its Edge Network infrastructure in recent weeks](https://vercel.com/blog/new-edge-dev-infrastructure). And, unlike Netlify's free tier, Vercel's free tier gives cheapos such as Yours Truly the full advantage of top-tier performance. I don't know **why** but, hey, gift horses’ mouths and all that stuff.

- By contrast, the performance of Netlify's free tier seems to be dragging even more lately --- particularly in the [TTFB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_byte) category. ([Waterfalls, waterfalls, waterfalls](https://web.dev/identify-resources-via-network-panel/).) That said,I can certainly understand if Netlify chooses not to put significant resources toward the freebie level. It's all business, of course. Fair enough.

- There's also the simple fact that I admire the opinions of the extremely smart guys who run Fathom Analytics, who are [moving their site to Vercel later this year](https://usefathom.com/blog/tech-stack). Learning that (which was after I'd moved back to Netlify, in my own defense) probably was the first thing that got me to re-thinking my re-think, if you will.

So we'll see if I stick around this time. I hope this is not going to be the site-hosting equivalent of [last year's SSG "dance."](/posts/2019/12/sorta-strange-ssg-trip/) And, if you're one of my few but highly appreciated regular visitors, I'm sure you share that hope.

**Note**: [To be continued](/posts/2020/09/goodbye-hello-part-4/) (sigh).
