Keeping this brief, for once&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

I will no longer be boring you with endless agonizing over which [static site generator](https://staticgen.com) (SSG) I'm using on this site.

While I plan to continue basing this site on [the JAMstack](https://jamstack.org), I won't commit to any particular way to do that. It's a decision that I will make based on whatever looks right at the time. As long as it isn't detrimental to the site's content, it's all good.

I **will** occasionally offer observations **about** SSGs, including how to install and use them, because I'm interested in them and, I gather, many of you readers are, too.

But I won't take sides again. At least, not overtly. (That is: those of you who like to peek at source code will be able to figure it out readily enough --- if you care, which I'm guessing you don't.)

In the last few months, I wrote several posts about switching or not switching around in the SSG arena. I portrayed each choice almost as  something to be carved in one's arm as a ritual, an undying commitment.

Yeah, right.

No one cares about which make of truck brought the food to the restaurant; they just expect, by God, to have **good** food served to them.

In the most recent such post, I had quoted "[The pros of using a boring stack](https://flaviocopes.com/boring-stack/)" by Flavio Copes, but apparently didn't grasp sufficiently the most telling point he made:

> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if you want to create a blog and be serious at it, then use the most boring and bulletproof thing you can find. Definitely **don’t work on your blog infrastructure if you want to do any serious blogging**.
>
> **The tech must go out of the way**[;] you should only **focus on the content**.
>
> Otherwise you'll spend most of your free time tweaking the blog platform (which --- let's be clear --- **no one except you cares about**) instead of writing content. No one cares about that infrastructure.

> One rule is that you know the pitfalls of your platform, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and you like to imagine new platforms being 100% perfect. That never happens, and the devil is in the details.

.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;because, even **in** that post where I quoted him, I was still going on about committing to one SSG over another.

I am a curious tech geek, so I will keep learning, and perhaps even switching platforms from time to time as the learning may dictate. This ain't the Army, after all. But I will do so without compromising what I bring to you here. There aren't many of you, so Google Analytics tells me daily, but I still appreciate your choice to stop by, and I intend to help you make the most of that choice.

And I **really** hope that's the last thing I need to say on that subject --- almost as much as some of you probably do.
