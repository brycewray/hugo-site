*This will be one of those "I don't know who needs to hear this, but . . ." sort of posts. If you're not someone who fits the description, I apologize in advance for wasting your time.*

In my years of using various technologies and tools, such as [static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators) (SSGs), to put content on the web, I've learned an important lesson. Or, I should say, I've *remembered* an important lesson I'd learned long ago in my [former](/posts/2021/09/transition/) working life. Here it is:

**Don't get freaked out by all the capabilities you *could* be using and, instead, focus for now only on what you *need* to use**. To put it another way: *minimal is okay*.

<!--more-->

What do I mean? Well, let me explain it by the examples from when I initially learned the lesson. Indeed, I learned and re-learned it numerous times.

I started using personal computers, [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word), and [QuarkXPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXPress) in the 1980s. Then I went on to HTML in the 1990s, followed by CSS in the 2000s (the "Aughts," as some call them), [content management systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) (CMSs) in the early 2010s, and SSGs in the late 2010s. So what's the common thread here? It's that, for each, I taught myself **not** to worry about **all** its capabilities, but, rather, to concentrate on mastering its capabilities **that I needed at the time**. After all, I reasoned, I can always learn about the other goodies later **if** necessary.

While it's technophobes to whom I usually give such advice, there are plenty of others who, although not *generally* afraid of technology, can find themselves experiencing occasional paralysis-by-analysis when some *particular* technology seems overwhelmingly powerful. "How can I ever get the hang of all these features?" they ask themselves.

The answer is: "You may not, and that's fine. Just learn what you *really* need to know." Such a requirement will change over time, and it's okay to take that time and learn more about the technology *as one needs to do so*, rather than trying to consume the whole thing all at once.

I know enough about each technology and tool I use to accomplish what **I want to do** with it. I don't worry about the rest. If I need to grasp more later, I'll **learn it later**.

Case in point: there are *many* capabilities in my two favorite SSGs, [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), that I've either never tried to use or, upon giving them a try, have decided I don't *need* to use them. But I haven't let such experiences keep me from making use of these SSGs for their capabilities that I **do** need. Are there other users out there writing incredible posts about how they **do** use these capabilities? Oh, my, yes. Does that mean **I** have to use them? No, not unless or until I see a need for them.

And the same is true for you, too. Embrace using a tool or technology only to the extent you need it, and be comfortable in deciding that you'll learn more about it if and when **you** decide you need that knowledge.

***Side note, in closing**: Obviously, you may have a work-based obligation to go beyond your comfort level in such matters, while this post --- also obviously --- is aimed at those who can make the choice entirely on their own. **However**, a **wise** supervisor won't need to have this explained; knowing it is part of being a good boss, especially where knowledge workers are concerned. And I say that after spending decades as just such a knowledge worker.*
