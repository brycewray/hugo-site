If you happen upon this site's repo out of curiosity and check out this post's Markdown file, you'll notice that this example's curly-bracketed boundaries also have wrapping `/*` and `*/`, respectively. That's because, otherwise, Hugo sees it as *real* code, not just a representation of it, and acts accordingly --- in this case, once again displaying the image. See "[Highlight Hugo/GO Template Code](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlight-hugogo-template-code)" in the Hugo documentation.
