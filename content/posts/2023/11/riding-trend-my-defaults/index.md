[Episode 97 of the *Hemispheric Views* podcast](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097), "Duel of the Defaults," has spurred a growing number of bloggers to [write about](https://defaults.rknight.me/) their chosen default apps and services. Having seen entries from several of my own favorite bloggers, I thought I'd join in.

<!--more-->

As I've explained before, I'm a Mac user, so all of these are for macOS unless otherwise noted.

- **Mail Client**: Usually the built-in Mail app these days, although I occasionally still use [MailMate](https://freron.com).
- **Mail Service**: [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com).
- **Notes**: [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com).
- **To-do**: The built-in Calendar app. (Remember, I'm [retired](/posts/2021/09/transition/), so I have much less of that kind of stuff to remember than is the case with most of the other folks on the roll of bloggers.)
- **Calendar**: Same as the previous item.
- **Phone photography**: iOS's built-in Camera app.
- **Photos management**: The built-in Photos app on both macOS and iOS.
- **Cloud storage for sync**: iCloud.
- **Cloud storage for backup**: [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage).
- **RSS**: [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/).
- **Contacts**: The built-in Contacts app.
- **Browser**: A Chromium-based one. Depending on my opinion at any given time, I jump around among [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge), and [Brave](https://brave.com), although [my recent tests](/posts/2023/10/testing-testing/) have steered me away from Brave for the most part.
- **Bookmarks**: [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io).
- **Word processing**: [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org).
- **Spreadsheets**: LibreOffice.
- **Music service/app**: Apple Music.
- **Podcasts**: The built-in Podcasts app.
- **Password management**: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com).

My list is shorter than many others', simply because this covers only what I actually use. In fact, I'm kind of stretching it to list word processing and spreadsheets because I rarely need either capability these days.

Anyway, those are *my* defaults as of now. If you're interested in being part of this little exercise, too, check the [bloggers list](https://defaults.rknight.me/) where, at the bottom, you'll see how to add your own contribution.
