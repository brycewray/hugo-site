Time again for [another](/posts/2023/08/mixed-nuts-12/) "Mixed nuts" post, in which I provide some [scattered](/posts/2019/11/mixed-nuts-2019-11/) ruminations from recent days. I've already shared some of these on social media, while others are making their world premieres here to absolutely no fanfare whatsoever, and deservedly so.

Watching the 2024 Tournament of Roses Parade live on linear TV reminded me why I can't stand to use a web browser without an ad blocker. Yeesh.

*I hate to say it, but a [recent kerfuffle with the Brave browser](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/35160), caused by a brief data corruption issue in one remotely hosted third-party filter list, has me reconsidering whether Google actually might **not** be The Great Satan at least regarding the (stated) reasoning behind Manifest V3: "With the introduction of Manifest V3, we will disallow remotely hosted code. This mechanism is used as an attack vector by bad actors to circumvent Google's malware detection tools and poses a significant risk to user privacy and security."*[^ChromeManifestV3]

[^ChromeManifestV3]: [Chromium Blog](https://blog.chromium.org/),  “[Manifest V3 now available on M88 Beta](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/12/manifest-v3-now-available-on-m88-beta.html)” <span class="nobrk">(2020-12-09)</span>.

[This op-ed](https://lite.cnn.com/2024/01/06/opinions/college-football-playoff-championship-leitch/index.html) for CNN by Will Leitch incorporates a lot of thoughts, many of them sad, that have been swirling through my brain during the 2023 college football season.

*I always suspected there might come a point where even my simple little site would no longer be readily convertible from [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and it seems I've reached that point. A few days ago, powered mainly by my curiosity about some features touted for the next major update, I made the effort. However, after achieving about 95% success, I saw that certain necessary styling I'd added to the site since my **last** such conversion attempt just flat-out wouldn't work in Tailwind without a ton of the `@apply` stuff that [Tailwind's own Adam Wathan says one shouldn't use](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1226511611592085504). So much for that. I'll continue to experiment with Tailwind on my own, but it apparently won't be part of this site.*

Coincidentally enough: the next day, I listened to [Syntax #713](https://syntax.fm/show/713/the-css-og-eric-meyer-1994-css-js-in-fridges-tailwind-and-web-standards), in which [CSS guru Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/) had some not-so-complimentary things to say about Tailwind and, by extension, other utility-based CSS frameworks. That made me feel somewhat better about my (apparently) wasted time the day before.

*I'm now using [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/), a macOS utility I've needed for ages but of which I was ignorant until seeing a [post](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/everything-i-install-and-set-up-on-a-new-macbook-as-a-web-developer/) that mentioned it. While there's a [FOSS version](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle), I was happy to pay for the Pro version because: (a.) its added feature set provided capabilities that were exactly what I needed; (b.) it was extremely inexpensive **and** also **not** a subscription; and (c.) I wanted to support the dev efforts that made it possible. I frequently move and reshape app windows on my 27-inch monitor, and Rectangle Pro makes that super-easy. Especially for someone such as I who prefers to do as much as possible through keyboard shortcuts, Rectangle Pro is a no-brainer.[^tiling] Highly, highly recommended.*

[^tiling]: I even kinda got a feel for why some Linux users are so into using [tiling window managers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-tiling-window-managers-for-linux-and-what-they-can-do-for-you/), although I don't care for some of the aesthetics that result from those.
