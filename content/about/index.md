So, who am I, and what business do I have putting yet another site on this already overstuffed Web?

I #amwriting, as the hashtag goes, and I will have more to say about that in time *if* I ever finish and publish the frickin' work-in-progress (WIP).[^RIPWIP] When the muse is in one of her oh-let's-go-"techy"-instead-of-"fictiony" moods and tells me to write here instead of in the WIP, I add to this site. Sometimes it's even about the app or apps I use to write, which leads me to the next point&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

[^RIPWIP]: [Well, so much for that](/posts/2020/04/murdered-darlings).

Am I anybody special? Nope; just an ordinary working guy who, for decades, has used a multitude of computing devices, operating systems, and apps---and learned a few things (and formed more than a few opinions) along the way. I've been told I can make complicated things easier to understand, and I try to do the same here.

Finally: since the Kewl Kids went off and left us non-[SSG](https://staticgen.com) users in the dust, it behooved me and my geek's curiosity to give this stuff a try, and that was the main reason I started the site in the first place. As one who's long delighted in hand-coding Web sites[^incorrigible] whenever possible, I love seeing the comeback of static sites.

[^incorrigible]: Yes, I still like to call them _Web sites_. I also use the [Oxford comma](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/). I am incorrigible.
