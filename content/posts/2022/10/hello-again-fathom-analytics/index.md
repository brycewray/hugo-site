This isn't, and likely never will be, a high-traffic website. But it has its moments. Occasionally, it catches eyes as a result of a mention on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), or [Dev.to](https://dev.to), or the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) [Discourse forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io). Or wherever. And, when that occurs, it's nice to be able to watch it happen. It gives me a clearer picture of where my readers are in the world, what browsers and devices they're using, and which sites sent them to me.

— Or, at least, that *had* been possible, back when I was using [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/ZKHYWX)[^affil] to monitor my site's traffic. As I [explained in June, 2020](/posts/2020/06/fathom-analytics-count-on-it/), Fathom is essentially the anti-Google-Analytics: it gives you all the traffic data you need, but **without** violating any visitor's privacy. I happily latched onto Fathom and kept a close watch on its data stream every day for the next two years.

[^affil]: That's an affiliate link, with that affiliation explained in the main body of this post: *i.e.*, if you use it to sign up with Fathom, you get a $10 credit toward your first month with Fathom (and, yes, I get a little commission).

Then, this past June, as I wrote in "[A goodbye to analytics](/posts/2022/06/goodbye-analytics/)," I decided that my traffic no longer justified having Fathom, so I didn't renew my annual[^rates] subscription.

[^rates]: You can subscribe to Fathom on either a monthly or annual basis, but the latter is cheaper on an annualized basis: each year, you get two months' worth of data services for free.

Well, the traffic likely is no better, but today I came back to Fathom, anyway. Why? Two reasons, mainly.

First: after I checked the numbers from the affiliate referral commission I still receive even after having ceased to be an active customer, I realized those funds were actually more than paying for a bottom-tier Fathom subscription, just as I'd had before.

Second: as I wrote today in an update to "A goodbye to analytics" . . .

> I like using products made by good people for good purposes, and the folks at Fathom surely fit that description.

Thus, I've gladly reunited with Fathom.

If *your* site needs analytics, but you don't want all the ugliness that Google Analytics inflicts upon your unwary visitors[^techsavvy], I highly recommend you give Fathom a try. I certainly won't mind if you sign up through [this affiliate link](https://usefathom.com/ref/ZKHYWX), giving yourself a $10 first-month credit and me a little commission; but, even if you just go directly to the [main Fathom site](https://usefathom.com) and sign up there, you'll be making a very wise choice.

[^techsavvy]: Besides, tech-savvy users usually block Google Analytics (and most other such intrusions), thus depriving you of accurate data where those visitors are concerned.

Before I wrap up this piece, I think I should add one more thing.

Some readers with their own websites [told](/contact/) me they agreed with my earlier departure from Fathom, not because they had a problem with Fathom but rather because they purposely avoid using *any* analytics for their sites. They said they prefer, instead, to write about what they *want* to cover, without worrying about any resulting numbers.

Well, that's a perfectly legitimate point of view, and **I share it** --- at least the part about content. After all, if I wrote based on likely traffic rather than my own nerdy predilections, you'd see a totally different set of content around here.

So, yes, the numbers are back; but, no, they won't have one tiny effect on my freedom to pick any subject matter on which I want to share some thoughts. After all, that's part of [CTCAJW Mode](/posts/2022/05/simplify-simplify-maybe-for-real-this-time/), to which I've committed the site for the remainder of its days, whatever *that* particular number may be.
