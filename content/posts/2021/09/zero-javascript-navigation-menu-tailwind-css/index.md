{{% disclaimer %}}

If your static website uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and you've been looking for a Tailwind-based, responsive, **zero**-JavaScript navigation menu, you've come to the right place. I'll provide its code in a bit. First, let me provide some background.

When I originally put this site on the web three years ago this month, I didn't yet know of the importance of having a navigation menu which was:

- CSS-only (or [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)-only) with absolutely no JavaScript, so it works with virtually any modern browser, device, or environment.
- Responsive, serving as a "hamburger" menu for small screen widths but a regular nav bar otherwise.
- Accessible, including keyboard-only navigability.

However, by the end of that year, this site's menu was all of those. I built it by borrowing shamelessly from a [Codepen](https://codepen.io/kevinpowell/pen/jxppmr) by [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/). Over time, I learned to make it work under various styling configurations --- first with Sass, then with Tailwind, then with more-or-less vanilla CSS (albeit enhanced by [PostCSS](https://postcss.org)). As regular readers of this site know, I've gone back and forth among those three ever since; and, currently, the site is back on Tailwind.

On occasion during my "Tailwind phases," I strayed from the zero-JavaScript approach (adding just a tiny bit of functionality with JavaScript) but, for reasons I won't cover herein, found it not to my liking. I kept wondering why I couldn't simply adapt the pure-CSS logic from Kevin Powell's original menu so it would work in Tailwind.

And, finally, I did. The results are the subject of this post.

## Code, please

Yeah, I know: that's enough talk. Let's get to the code, **after** I provide just a little more info that will help you read and understand it:

- This works with Tailwind CSS 2.2.x. With other versions, past or future, YMMV, although I'd **guess** future versions will be OK with it.
- The HTML part is in the [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templating language which this [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)-based site uses. Although much of it is indistinguishable from vanilla HTML, there are places --- notably the part which derives the "newest post" item in the nav menu --- where you see Nunjucks.
- I will also include the `tailwind.config.js` file for your reference.
- Because I was trying to make the CSS 100% Tailwind (but finally couldn't, as I'll note below), the site uses the [`tailwindcss-logical`](https://github.com/stevecochrane/tailwindcss-logical) plugin to add another three utilities to Tailwind:
	- `mbs-0` = `margin-block-start: 0px`.
	- `mbe-0` = `margin-block-end: 0px`.
	- `pis-0` = `padding-inline-start: 0px`.
- As for that failed attempt to stick with Tailwind-only CSS in the menu, here's what happened. While [Tailwind 2.2.x added sibling selector variants](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v2.2.0#sibling-selector-variants), those didn't provide quite enough functionality to allow me to avoid using just a **little** extra CSS (239 bytes) to finish the job.
- The menu contains the code for three SVGs, appearing in this order:
	- The "hamburger" of the mobile-device hamburger menu.
	- The "&times;" for closing the hamburger menu.
	- The site's "BW" logo (obviously not applicable to **your** use).
- The file location in each case is from the top level of the Eleventy project.

## There are better ones

As I've often noted about my offerings on this site, you can find better menus, better use of Tailwind, and better code in general. I put this out here simply because **I've** often searched for a menu just like this and, in the end, never found one that met all my requirements. (For the record, this one doesn't, either, but it will **if** I can find a way to incorporate the `nav.css` stuff into Tailwind.) Perhaps this will serve a purpose for you.
