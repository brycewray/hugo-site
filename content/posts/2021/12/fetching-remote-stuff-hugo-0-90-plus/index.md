**Important update**: I have updated this article due to the [release of Hugo 0.91.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.91.0), which made a breaking change in the feature around which my original text was centered. **In short**: Hugo 0.90.x used `resources.Get` to fetch remote items but Hugo 0.91.0+ uses `resources.GetRemote` instead, so I've altered this article accordingly. You may wish to check [Hugo Issue #9285](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/9285) to see why the change occurred.

The [release earlier this week of version 0.90.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.90.0) of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators) (SSG) suddenly made its [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes) asset pipeline considerably more powerful by adding, for the first time, the ability to fetch and process *remote* assets. Previously, Hugo Pipes could work with only *local* assets ‚Äî *i.e.*, files actually in a Hugo project‚Äôs repository. Now, as the 0.90.0 release notes explained:

> The support for remote `Resources` in `resources.Get` has been a feature in great demand. This means that you can fetch remote files (images, JSON files, RSS feeds, [etc.]) and use them in Hugo Pipes functions as [if] they were local.

My initial reaction was: well, that‚Äôs surely cool, but I doubt I‚Äôll ever need that functionality in my own relatively limited use[^1] of Hugo. Then, yesterday, a tweet by long-renowned Hugo expert [R√©gis Philibert](https://github.com/regisphilibert) gave me second thoughts:

> With [@GoHugoIO](https://twitter.com/GoHugoIO) latest and its supercharged \`resource.Get\` there's no more limit to what your favorite SSG can fetch from the cloud!
>
> Any kind of files really, but a full fledged fetch like API is really what I was waiting for.
>
> And boy am I ü§©.\

And, lo and behold, it hit me this morning: this new ability by Hugo to fetch remote stuff meant, now, I could use [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)-encoded [low-quality image placeholders](https://www.guypo.com/introducing-lqip-low-quality-image-placeholders) (LQIPs) in my image-handling shortcode (most recently described in ‚Äú[Go big or Go home? The sequel](/posts/2021/11/go-big-go-home-sequel/)‚Äù).

So what, you say? Well, this is what: now, the shortcode could ***halve*** its image-related [HTTP requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) to my free [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) account.[^2] [Since HTTP requests are render-blocking, it‚Äôs always better to have fewer of them](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/reduce-http-requests).

You see, up to then, the shortcode got each image‚Äôs LQIP by having Cloudinary generate a tiny, 20-pixel-wide version of the original image. While that worked well enough for client-side viewing, it also meant that, for *each* image, I was sending two HTTP requests to Cloudinary: one for the original image and one for the LQIP.

However, starting with Hugo 0.90.x, Hugo Pipes can go right out to Cloudinary, pull down that 20-pixel-wide image, and instantly translate it into Base64-encoded data that fits right into my HTML. Since this is all happening during the site-building process, visitors not only *don‚Äôt* encounter a slowdown in the image-handling but also *don‚Äôt* make that extra HTTP request for a separate file.

Rather than bore you with the entire shortcode, given that I just got through doing that [a few posts ago](/posts/2021/11/go-big-go-home-sequel/), I‚Äôll simply show you the parts that changed.[^simpler]

```go-html-template
{{/* These two variables are new */}}
{{- $LQIPdata := printf "%s%s%s" $cloudiBase $LQIPholder $src -}}
{{- $LQIP_get := resources.GetRemote $LQIPdata -}}

<div class="relative bg-center" style="background: url(data:image/jpeg;base64,{{ $LQIP_get.Content | base64Encode }}); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat;" aspect-ratio="{{ $width }} / {{ $height }}">
```

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on:

- The `$LQIPdata` variable declaration uses concatenation to supply the Cloudinary-based LQIP‚Äôs URL.
- `$LQIP_get` is where the Hugo 0.90.x magic comes in, as the newly souped-up Hugo Pipes functionality uses `GetRemote` to pull that LQIP directly from Cloudinary.
- In the `div` element, `$LQIP_get.Content | base64Encode` converts the result of `$LQIP_get` into Base64-encoded data and uses it as the `div`‚Äôs `background`.[^shortcode]

**Update, 2021-12-18**: [Hugo 0.90.1](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.90.1) added some error-handling for those cases where a remote resource might **not** be available after all (hey, even Cloudinary could "blink" occasionally), which would cause the Hugo build to fail when trying to access it.[^why] Based on a [suggestion I received via Twitter from Hugo maintainer Bj√∏rn Erik Pedersen](https://twitter.com/bepsays/status/1472259051354570752) as well as the [Hugo 0.90.1 release documentation](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.90.1), here is an ultra-simplified form of a more resilient example:

```go-html-template
{{- $LQIPdata := printf "%s%s%s" $cloudiBase $LQIPholder $src -}}
{{- $LQIP_get := resources.GetRemote $LQIPdata -}}

{{ if $LQIP_get.Err }}
	{{ warnf "%s" . }}
	{{/*
	We output an error message.
	*/}}
{{ else }}
	{{/*
	[Handle things normally.]
	*/}}
{{ end }}
```

*(You could handle this more elaborately, of course. For example, you could specify that, if Hugo can't fetch a desired remote asset, it instead uses a generic, locally sourced asset as an emergency substitute. However, that goes a bit beyond the scope of this post.)*

&nbsp;<br />
For something that I originally thought wouldn‚Äôt ring my chimes, this new power in Hugo Pipes turns out to be pretty frickin‚Äô amazing. Whether I‚Äôll find additional uses for it is unclear, but I already consider it a winner. And I can only imagine the cool stuff that it will enable for the real experts out there in the Hugo-verse.

[^1]:	That is, as compared to that of the regulars in the [Hugo Discourse forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io).

[^2]:	For more on how I started using Cloudinary‚Äôs generous free tier to host this site‚Äôs images, please see also my post, ‚Äú[Transformed](/posts/2020/07/transformed/).‚Äù

[^simpler]: This is simpler than what I originally put in this post because I‚Äôm now excluding some host-specific stuff that‚Äôs likely irrelevant to anybody else.

[^shortcode]:	If you compare this to the earlier version of the shortcode, please note that I‚Äôm using `background` here rather than the previous `background-image`. That‚Äôs because, this time, the HTML is calling to data rather than an image file. Also, I put the `background-size` and `background-repeat` information in the element, rather than using previously set utility classes, because ‚Äî well, it just worked better that way, and for reasons I honestly don‚Äôt know. (**Update, 2021-12-18**: This now uses inline styling rather than the more convoluted way I did it originally, and thus would run afoul of a truly strict [Content Security Policy](https://content-security-policy.com).)

[^why]: As the [Hugo 0.90.1 release documentation](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.90.1) says: "Note that if you do not handle `.Err` yourself, Hugo will fail the build the first time you start using the failed `Resource` object."
