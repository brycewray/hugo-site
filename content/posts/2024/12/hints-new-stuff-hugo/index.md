If you typically don't follow the social media postings from the team behind the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator, you might have missed yesterday's highly interesting disclosures about the next full version of Hugo.

As of this writing, the latest major release of Hugo is v.0.139.0 (2024-11-18). There is no fixed cadence for Hugo full releases; but, given that the Hugo team is now willing to share these intriguing nuggets about what I presume will be v.0.140.0, one could guess that we won't have to wait long to get our digital hands on the promised goodies in this next version.

Not that it matters.

Because the Hugo team has been stuck in beta for years and refuses to follow semantic versioning, any upgrade is potentially breaking in very major ways.

Most folks I know never upgrade as a result.
