Here's a quickie post to advise that I've found my way to another [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) instance. This time, I'm on the Big Kahuna itself, [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social), as [@BryceWray@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@BryceWray).

This makes my fourth primary Mastodon location in the last few months:

- I started with (1.) mastodon.technology [but it went away, so I moved](/posts/2022/10/move-mastodon/) to (2.) [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org).
- Then, three months later to the day --- after [deciding the stuff I follow, boost, and post might not be a good fit for the local timelines of the great folks at Fosstodon](/posts/2023/01/another-move-mastodon/) --- I slid over to (3.) the more general [mstdn.social](https://mstdn.social). The truth is that I actually wanted to come straight to mastodon.social at that time but, because the Big Kahuna is **so** big, there are times when it's just flat-out not accepting new accounts; so I stuck with mstdn.social for a few weeks and waited until I could make this jump.
- And now, here I am on (4.) mastodon.social.

Incidentally: although I'd used the `BryceWrayTX` handle on the other instances, mainly because that had long been my Twitter handle, I'm using just `BryceWray` on mastodon.social because, in fact, I'd *had* a mastodon.social account with that handle some time back before deleting it; and, as I learned today, [that locked it up permanently](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/4614), so I went `TX`-less in this new account. (I assure my fellow Texans I meant no offense in doing so.)

My exploration of the FediVerse continues.
