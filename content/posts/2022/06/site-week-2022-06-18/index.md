**Note**: To avoid spamming social media *every* time I issue a post, I use each entry in this series to list what I've published since the previous "The site this week" post. (Then, I promote **this**.)

Here are my posts from this past week . . .

- <span class="sansSerif"><strong class="pokey">2022-06-12</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Sorta scoped styling in Hugo](/posts/2022/06/sorta-scoped-styling-hugo/)\
*Interested in more efficient CSS for your site? Hugo doesn't make it easy, but here's a suggested way you might get there.*

- <span class="sansSerif"><strong class="pokey">2022-06-13</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Using iCloud Mail with a custom domain](/posts/2022/06/using-icloud-mail-custom-domain/)\
*It took Apple a while to get it (maybe) right --- but it's "so far, so good" on something announced at last year's WWDC.*

- <span class="sansSerif"><strong class="pokey">2022-06-15</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[IE's dead, Jim](/posts/2022/06/ies-dead-jim/)\
*Years after Microsoft told people to stop using Internet Explorer, the hoary browser at last is (mostly) no more.*
