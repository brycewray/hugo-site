**Note**: This is the conclusion of a five-part series about how you can set up [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) in websites built by three different [static site generators](https://staticgen.com): [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) (the subject of [Part 2](/posts/2020/04/webmentions-three-ssgs-2/)), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) (the subject of [Part 3](/posts/2020/04/webmentions-three-ssgs-3/)), and [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) (covered in detail in [Part 4](/posts/2020/04/webmentions-three-ssgs-4/)).

**Added note, 2020-07-26**: I have now archived the various configuration files linked within this series within a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/brycewray/files-webmentions) of their own and changed the links accordingly, so as to make them immune to ongoing changes in the repos originally linked from this series.

[Yes, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_Virginia,_there_is_a_Santa_Claus), there *is* an end to this series.

Especially for those of you who took my [Part 1](/posts/2020/04/webmentions-three-ssgs-1/) recommendation to heart and read, or at least skimmed, through it all and in order: I apologize for the length of this series. Still, it could've been worse. I originally wrote it as *one long post* before deciding to break that up into five parts (intro, Eleventy-specific part, Hugo-specific part, Gatsby-specific part, and this wrap-up). When I realized that most people would want this information as it relates to only *one* of these SSGs, I knew I had to break it up into parts.

But, even so, even in parts: why so *many* details?

Because I'd been there.

As a result of my own struggles in finding answers, much less *explicable* ones, during this effort of putting webmentions into not only my [Eleventy-based site repository](https://github.com/brycewray/eleventy_bundler) but also my [Hugo-based](https://github.com/brycewray/hugo_site_css-grid) and [Gatsby-based](https://github.com/brycewray/gatsby_site_css-grid) public repos, I considered it more valuable to get everything in, rather than be brief for brevity's sake. (As if I ever do that, anyway, y'know.)

So, maybe, only a very small percentage of my already small complement of readers will ever see, much less use, the content. But, for those who *really, really need it*: there you go. I hope it helps.


## Bibliography for the series

Finally, here's that bibliography I've been flogging for all four parts up to now.

*Everybody* interested in implementing webmentions in static sites should find this useful, even if they don't specifically use any of the three SSGs I mentioned. Every developer article in this list has a link to the person's public repo, which I found *at least* as helpful as the article itself. As always, I sit on the shoulders of people who are *far* smarter than I, and I am immensely grateful to them.

Also, it'll often surprise me what I pick up from how others’ code works, especially when the thing I learn isn't even what prompted my search in the first place. Serendipity is cool.
