This'll be short. It's just an update on some good news I'd previously mentioned.

The old saying is that "Life is what happens when you're making other plans." True dat, as the kids were saying a few years ago.

I [told](/posts/2019/09/now-im-sixty-four) you back in September that we were awaiting our first grandchild; then, in November, I [noted](/posts/2019/11/mixed-nuts-2019-11) that we'd learned she'd be a granddaughter, arriving in April.

Granddaughter? Check. But arriving in April? Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

This past Saturday morning, March 7, I ran a quick errand and, planning to have a restful weekend from there, started to write what was to have been the next post here. Suddenly, I heard my wife's distressed voice from down the hall: a text from our daughter said her "water" had "broken" and she was already at the hospital.

Ohhhhhhkay. So much for plans.

About nine hours after we received that "breaking" news (sorry), Kennedy Lane Beck arrived. She weighed five pounds, one ounce, and measured eighteen-and-a-quarter inches in length. Mom, Dad, and Kennedy are all fine---the normal sleepless experience for new parents notwithstanding---and are now home.

As I close this little update about this new little one, please allow "Pawpaw"---as I apparently will be called---to share a small smattering of photos about this momentous event in our little family. Think of it as the online equivalent of what I'd have done if this were decades ago and we met on the street, in which case I'd be whipping out a wallet containing photographs of the new arrival.
