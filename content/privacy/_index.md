This site and its owner **do NOT** store your personal information **in any way**. However, the site does use certain **externally hosted** services, each of which has its own privacy policies and methods of complying with applicable privacy regulations.

## Notes about external services

### Analytics

#### Fathom Analytics

This site uses [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com), which [does not store your personal data in any way](https://usefathom.com/blog/anonymization). Please refer also to my article, “[Fathom Analytics: Count on it](/posts/2020/06/fathom-analytics-count-on-it).”

#### Plausible Analytics

At this time, the site is also on a free 30-day trial of [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io), which is [similarly privacy-focused](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics). The trial is due to end near the end of October.

#### Cloudflare Browser Insights

This site’s traffic goes through [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) and is configured to use its Browser Insights tool. Cloudflare says Browser Insights “collects the bare minimum amount of information, timing metrics, to show customers how their websites perform” and that “Cloudflare does not track individual end-users *[sic]* across our customers’ Internet properties.” For more details, see [this Cloudflare support article](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033929991-Cloudflare-Browser-Insights) and the Cloudflare blog post, “[Introducing Browser Insights](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-browser-insights/).”

### FastComments

This site uses [FastComments](https://fastcomments.com) for commenting (currently on a trial basis, which is due to expire November 10, 2020). For more details, please refer to the [FastComments privacy policy](https://fastcomments.com/privacy-policy).

### Google Fonts

When I learned that the use of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) *served from* Google transmit a visitor's apparently **not** anonymized IP address[^Issue1495] to Google, I quit using this product (and suggesting to others that they use it) and, instead, served from my own site any typefaces that aren’t part of the so-called “[system fonts stack](/posts/2018/10/web-typography-part-2).”

[^Issue1495]: For the discussion that convinced me to go this route after my initial skepticism about its necessity, see the Google Fonts GitHub issue, “[GDPR compliance](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/1495).”

## Other considerations

### Embedded videos

I no longer embed YouTube or other sites’ videos, since they can and do transmit personal information through cookies. In the two instances where I formerly did—”[Some curmudgeonish thoughts](/posts/2018/11/some-curmudgeonish-thoughts)" and "[Coherence and COVID-19](/posts/2020/03/coherence-covid-19)”—I replaced them with clearly identified links to their original locations, and footnoted each link with a reference and link to this privacy policy.

### Twitter content

I no longer embed tweets, since they can and do transmit personal information through cookies. I have replaced formerly embedded tweets with just their text content combined with clearly identified links to their original locations, and footnoted each link (or set of links where multiple tweets were quoted, as in the case of “[Backtracking to Big G](/posts/2019/08/backtracking-to-big-g)”) with a reference and link to this privacy policy.
