Here's a quickie reminder, especially for my fellow Americans who may be about to check out mentally because of the upcoming long holiday weekend . . .

The first-ever **[HugoConf](https://hugoconf.io)**, a **free** online event for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) users (or those curious about it) under the aegis of [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com), is happening the **following** weekend, Friday--Saturday, July 8--9 <span class="pokey">(U.S. time)</span>. It's already got hundreds of registrants (it had nearly 250 as of [several weeks ago](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/hugoconf-2022/38570/3)), but there's still time to be one of them.

**Sign up at [hugoconf.io](https://hugoconf.io).**

*(I'm getting not one thing in return for posting this. I just think it'd be a shame if you miss out on what apparently is going to be a pretty cool event for anyone with the slightest interest in Hugo.)*
