If you're at all familiar with [Jeff Delaney](https://twitter.com/JeffDelaney23)'s [Fireship channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship) --- the slogan of which is "the gateway drug for developers" --- you know he often issues videos in his "100 Seconds of [x]" series. In each, he runs through an entertaining, breezy, animated summary of something he (almost always accurately) thinks will interest other developers.

Today, he issued one about the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator, so I pass it along for your edification:
