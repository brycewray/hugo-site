A year ago, I was active on the Twitter, Reddit, and Mastodon social media platforms --- I wasn't exactly a "doom-scroller," but I kept tabs on all three pretty regularly --- with no expectation that would change any time soon.

Well, it did.

I've already recounted how I [left Elon Musk's Twitter](/posts/2022/11/abandon-sinking-ship/), only to [come crawling back](/posts/2023/03/reluctant-return-twitter/) because I missed the information I could glean from it even now. However, in the ensuing weeks, I found the experience increasingly less useful. Finally, I noticed that I no longer was going there much, after all; so, today, I once again left.

In somewhat similar fashion, my departure from the Fediverse was motivated more by growing indifference than anything else. But, unlike my feelings about what Twitter has become, I still wish the Fediverse well. I just lost interest in staying.

As for Reddit: what caused me to leave it[^Reddit] was its [decision](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) to price its APIs beyond what devs of third-party Reddit apps could afford. I deleted all my old Reddit content and killed my account a few days ago, prior to today's [sad announcement of the death of the Apollo app](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/reddits-new-api-pricing-will-kill-off-apollo-on-june-30/) because of Said Reddit Decision. *That* event would've been the last straw had I not already made my move.

[^Reddit]: I should add that, in recent months, I hadn't really been that active on Reddit, either.

Don't misunderstand. I'm not claiming purity. I still spend what probably is too much time viewing stuff on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) but I've sensed the quality of even its discourse subtly, gradually eroding in recent months, so it may be next.

I was a daily user of Facebook for the better part of a decade, but I did finally cease to care, and killed my account. That was over six years ago, and I've never looked back. We'll see whether I can be equally resolute about these latest goodbyes to platforms which, in my view, have outlived their usefulness --- certainly to me.

**Update, 2023-06-09**: Ironically, a few hours after initially publishing this post, I received an invite --- requested weeks ago, before my social media ennui had set in --- to the still-in-beta [Bluesky](https://bsky.app). I'm giving it a try as [@brycewray.com](https://bsky.app/profile/brycewray.com) (it lets you use your custom domain as a handle), and finding some nice folks that I'd followed elsewhere. Perhaps this experience will be somewhat less *meh*. One can hope.\

**Further update, 2023-07-21**: After a few weeks, I realized I'd lost interest in Bluesky, too, so I deleted my account there today.
