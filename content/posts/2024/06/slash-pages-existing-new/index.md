I would go so far as to guess that a typical personal website has "slash" pages --- `/about`, `/contact`, and so forth --- but so far hasn't referred to them as such. Because of a page of which I first learned this past weekend, that may occasion some changes. It certainly has with my site.

After reading "[Slash Pages](https://slashpages.net/)," of which I first learned in Manuel "Manu" Moreale's "[Slashes](https://manuelmoreale.com/slashes)" (<span class="nobrk">2024-06-01</span>), I decided to revamp my site a bit. First, I added these new "slash" pages:

- **[Blogroll](/blogroll/)** --- A list, one which I will strive to keep updated, of those sites whose feeds I follow. And, on that subject . . .
- **[Follow](/follow/)** --- I took my own feed links and social links off my [Contact](/contact/) "slash" page and moved them to this page, in keeping with the arrangement described in the "Slash Pages" post to which I linked above. The Contact page still has my email address, of course.
- **[Colophon](/colophon/)** --- This explains how I build and maintain the site. Note that I took some info from the [About](/about/) "slash" page's footer and moved it here, thus eliminating the need to cram it all into that specific footer. This page will also need updating from time to time, I would guess.

I then added these (as well as the [Sitemap](/sitemap/) "slash" page) to the site's navigation menu, and revised the menu's appearance so it will work better with large screens. (On small screens, a hamburger menu still handles it all.)

There are quite a few other possibilities for "slash" pages, as those earlier links explain, but these will suffice for now here. And, no, I won't start always calling them "slash" pages! That served a purpose here, but probably would be just plain annoying elsewhere.
