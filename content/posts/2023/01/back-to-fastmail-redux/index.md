A few weeks ago, I wrote what I thought would be [the last installment](/posts/2022/11/using-icloud-mail-custom-domain-its-fifty-bucks/) of my multi-month, six-post exploration about whether to host my custom-domains email on [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com) or Apple's [iCloud+](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/icloud-overview-mmfc854d9604/icloud). Ah, but it's never quite that simple where I'm concerned, so here's post #7 on this subject.<!--more-->

For those not familiar with the earlier episodes in this farce, here's a TL;DR version for you.

In 2017, I began using Fastmail to provide custom-domain hosting of my email. In 2021, I added a second domain to that; and, also that year, Apple announced it would begin offering custom-domain(s) support in iCloud Mail for iCloud+ subscribers. I waited until mid-2022 to give it a serious try. It didn't take me long to confirm the technical superiority of Fastmail but that service was an additional $50 a year, while I was already paying for iCloud+. So, in that supposed-to-have-been final post in the series, I put down my metaphorical foot and went with iCloud simply for the money-saving aspect.

As you've probably guessed by now, I changed my mind yet again, and brought my email back to Fastmail earlier today.

Why? Well, in no particular order:

- I found other ways to cut expenses, more-or-less compensating for the added cost of Fastmail. At least one of them wasn't even available (as far as I knew) when I began this whole experiment; I'll leave that tale for another time.
- As I kept running into things about iCloud's IMAP setup that annoyed me (as [before](/posts/2022/09/using-icloud-mail-custom-domain-retreat/)), I longed for Fastmail's much better and smoother [JMAP](https://fastmail.blog/open-technologies/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/) implementation.[^connSpeed]
- My Apple gear, all purchased years ago within the same 12-month span, is nearing a collective age which will force me to consider multiple replacements in the not-too-distant future. There's obviously a certain degree of ecosystem lock-in when using iCloud to host one's custom-domains email, and I didn't want to restrict my future options more than utterly necessary. Fastmail works well with nearly every OS and device I might consider.

[^connSpeed]: Moving my 27 years' worth of email from Fastmail to iCloud usually took several days, but going the opposite direction took roughly eight *hours*; and it would've involved even less time had it not been for iCloud's off-and-on glitchiness during the process. I was moving a little under four [GiB](https://massive.io/file-transfer/gb-vs-gib-whats-the-difference/), a little at a time as I recreated my one-folder-per-year Archive setup, via a fiber connection that generally uploads at about the 425--450 Mbps range. I used [MailMate](https://freron.com), having [previously learned](/posts/2022/09/using-icloud-mail-custom-domain-return/) that only MailMate's muscle --- *i.e.*, as opposed to that of Apple Mail --- was up to the task of minimizing iCloud's aforementioned glitchiness.

Incidentally: in coming back to Fastmail today, I had to start a new subscription, because I'd killed the old one last month just a couple of days before it would've reached auto-renewal. To save a few bucks per year (and to avoid any inflationary nastiness), I locked in for three years. So, since I assume there won't suddenly be magical remedies for all my above-stated objections to iCloud-hosted email, it seems this really, for God's sake, is the closing chapter of this little clambake.

. . . Well, that is, at least until sometime in late 2025. (I know myself all too well.)
